I am Lingxia QIAO (乔灵霞), a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Irvine, under the supervision of Professor [Qing Nie](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/qnie/). I received my Ph.D. in Probability and Statistics from the Center for Quantitative Biology, Peking University, in July 2020, under the supervision of Professor  [Lei Zhang](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~zhanglei/). My doctoral dissertation, titled Quantitative Studies of Bi-functional Biological Networks and Bivalent Chromatin, explored the statistical and dynamical principles underlying epigenetic regulation and complex gene regulatory networks. I earned a B.S. in Basic Medical Sciences (School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University) and, as a double degree, a B.S. in Statistics (School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University) in 2015.

From 2020 to 2021, I was a visiting scholar at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, Peking University. Since 2021, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Irvine, working with Professor Qing Nie.

My research lies at the intersection of mathematical modeling, machine learning, and quantitative biology. By integrating computational modeling and data-driven approaches, I aim to understand how cells communicate and coordinate across tissues. In particular, I focus on inferring cell–cell communication networks from single-cell, spatial, and multi-omics data across diverse biological systems—including the brain, skin, muscle, and liver—under both normal and disease conditions. My work is carried out in close collaboration with experimental biologists, including Dr. Qin Yang, Dr. Xiangmin Xu, Dr. Xing Dai, and Dr. Armando Villalta.

My broader research interests include mathematical modeling, machine learning, biological data science, computational systems biology, stochastic dynamics, and nonlinear dynamics.
